Hey Y'all we are using the latest version of Unity, Unity 2019.3.1f1, to get this you can either go through Unity HUB ( A version control software for Unity) https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal

When Installing, We are going to need the IOS and Android Modules for Unity, so we can export to those platforms. If you also havent, I would recommend downloading the JDK that comes with the android package in case ( im not sure what difference it makes but I have gone ahead and done that)

https://github.com/Ljeytl/Outliers a link to the Github. Give me your Github Username or Email so I can add you as a contributor
GitHub

For Source control, I am using Github Desktop. You are welcome to use whatever method you want, but I would highly advice, especially if you are new to Source Control, to use desktop as its very easy to push and pull files and I will add branches as necessary
